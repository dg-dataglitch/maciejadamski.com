# Hello World

Welcome to my new personal website. As a software engineer, I wanted a place to share my thoughts and experiences without the bloat of modern web frameworks.

## The Tech Stack

I decided to build this site using a custom Static Site Generator (SSG) written in Go. Why?

1. **Simplicity**: I have full control over the rendering pipeline.
2. **Performance**: Static files are fast. Go is fast. The build process is instant.
3. **Learning**: It's a great way to experiment with Go templates and filesystem operations.

## Design Philosophy

The design is intentionally minimal.

* **Font**: JetBrains Mono. Monospaced fonts are the native language of developers.
* **Colors**: Black and White. High contrast, easy to read, no distractions.
* **Content**: Markdown. Simple to write, portable, and version controllable.

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

* Go programming patterns
* System architecture
* Data engineering at **Dataglitch**
* And other interesting technical challenges I encounter.

Stay tuned.
